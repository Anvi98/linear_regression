# ML- Basic Linear Regression model - From Scratch using python.

## Learning objectives

- How a basic linear regression model works.


## Description

In this repository, I show how to implement a very basic linear regression model using python python. I intentionally didn't used OOP programming because there is no need for this simple task, but anyone could give it a try as an extra exercise.


This is how the model learns through the training phase:

At the begining, the weights and bias (parameters) are initialized to random values. (Actually there is a lot to say about how to correctly initialize the the weights at the begining but let make it simple for this task.)

### General Good Practice

- Make sure that there are [no linter errors](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config).
- Make sure that I used correct flow [Gitflow](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/git-github/articles/github_flow.md).
- Make sure that I documented your work [in a professional way](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-transversal-skills/blob/main/documentation/articles/professional_repo_rules.md).


### Task requirements

- This task does not require any libraries requirements excepts numpy and matplotlib.

so be sure to have numpy and matplotlib on your system otherwise run this on your terminal:

```
    pip install numpy matplotlib
```
